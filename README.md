## [Wardrobe]

Your Wardrobe consists of saved outfits. To choose one, just select the one you desire. Now you have the following options:
 1. Wear Outfit: Make your habbo wear this outfit. (Sometimes you need to click multiple times on this button as the connection sometimes gets interupted)
 2. Delete: Delete this outfit from your Wardrobe.
 3. Delete All: Delete all saved outfits in your Wardrobe.

## [Custom Figure]

You can also import a custom outfit. To do this you need to have the figure string and the gender of your habbo (M/F). The format goes as shown below:
```
hr-3163-45.hd-180-1390.ch-3432-110-1408.lg-3434-110-1408.sh-3435-110-92.ha-3431-110-1408.cc-3360-110:M
```
To import your custom outfit, perform the next steps:
 1. Place the desired figure string into the text field.
 2. Select the gender of the outfit (either M or F for Male and Female).
 3. (OPTIONAL) Specify the name of the outfit.
 4. Click on "Add to Wardrobe"
 5. It now should be added to your Wardrobe.

## [Other Habbo's]

 You can also copy outfits of other Habbo's.
 1. Go into a room 
 2. Select the user
 3.  (OPTIONAL) Specify the name of the outfit.
 4. Click on "Add to Wardrobe".
 5. The outfit can be found in your Wardrobe.

# Important to know
If you installed the extension while being into a room and you would like to copy someone's outfit, you would need to reload the room first as the extension couldn't register every other outfit in the room. In conclusion, this does NOT need to be done every once you would like to copy someone's outfit!

If you recently (in the last 10seconds) changes your outfit, sometimes habbo needs a delay. In this delay you're not able to change your outfit so i suggest waiting 5-10 seconds and clicking on "Wear outfit" again.
